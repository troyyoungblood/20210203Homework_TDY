## Welcome to Web-Design_Challenge

This activity is the introduction to creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past assigment.

In building the dashboard, pages were created with different visualizations and a means to navigate between them.   A dropdown bar and active links assoicated with the images were used for the navigation. The visualizations have a brief corresponding explanations. The dashboard starts with a landing page, then a page for comparing all of the plots, then individual plot pages and ends with a page where the data can be viewed.
