## Welcome to Web-Design_Challenge

This activity is the introduction to creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations from a past assigment.

In building the dashboard, pages were created with different visualizations and a means to navigate between them.   A dropdown bar and active links assoicated with the images were used for the navigation. The visualizations have a brief corresponding explanations. The dashboard starts with a landing page, then a page for comparing all of the plots, then individual plot pages and ends with a page where the data can be viewed.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/troyyoungblood/Web-Design-Challenge/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/troyyoungblood/Web-Design-Challenge/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
